With [browserify](http://browserify.org), simply `require('buffer')` or use the `Buffer` global and you will get this module.

The goal is to provide an API that is 100% identical to
[node's Buffer API](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html). Read the
[official docs](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) for the full list of properties,
instance methods, and class methods that are supported.

## features

- Manipulate binary data like a boss, in all browsers -- even IE6!
- Super fast. Backed by Typed Arrays (`Uint8Array`/`ArrayBuffer`, not `Object`)
- Extremely small bundle size (**5.04KB minified + gzipped**, 35.5KB with comments)
- Excellent browser support (IE 6+, Chrome 4+, Firefox 3+, Safari 5.1+, Opera 11+, iOS, etc.)
- Preserves Node API exactly, with one important difference (see below)
- `.slice()` returns instances of the same type (Buffer)
- Square-bracket `buf[4]` notation works, even in old browsers like IE6!
- Does not modify any browser prototypes or put anything on `window`
- Comprehensive test suite (including all buffer tests from node.js core)


## install

To use this module directly (without browserify), install it:

```bash
npm install buffer
```

This module was previously called **native-buffer-browserify**, but please use **buffer**
from now on.


## usage

The module's API is identical to node's `Buffer` API. Read the
[official docs](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) for the full list of properties,
instance methods, and class methods that are supported.

As mentioned above, `require('buffer')` or use the `Buffer` global with
[browserify](http://browserify.org) and this module will automatically be included
in your bundle. Almost any npm module will work in the browser, even if it assumes that
the node `Buffer` API will be available.

To depend on this module explicitly (without browserify), require it like this:

```js
var Buffer = require('buffer/').Buffer  // note: the trailing slash is important!
```

To require this module explicitly, use `require('buffer/')` which tells the node.js module
lookup algorithm (also used by browserify) to use the **npm module** named `buffer`
instead of the **node.js core** module named `buffer`!


## how does it work?

The `Buffer` constructor returns instances of `Uint8Array` that are augmented with function properties for all the `Buffer` API functions. We use `Uint8Array` so that square bracket notation works as expected -- it returns a single octet. By augmenting the instances, we can avoid modifying the `Uint8Array` prototype.


## differences

#### IMPORTANT: always use `Buffer.isBuffer` instead of `instanceof Buffer`

The Buffer constructor returns a `Uint8Array` (with all the Buffer methods added as
properties on the instance) for performance reason
